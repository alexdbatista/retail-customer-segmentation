**Author:** Alex Domingues Batista, PhD  
**Background:** Analytical Chemistry | 16+ years research experience  
**Project Type:** Portfolio demonstration of statistical validation & methodological rigor

---

## Project Overview

This project applies PhD-level statistical validation methods from analytical science to customer behavior analysis. Rather than following a standard RFM tutorial, this analysis demonstrates:

- **Method validation** (RFM quartiles vs k-means clustering)
- **Sensitivity analysis** (quartile vs quintile binning stability testing)
- **Assumption testing** (correlation analysis, distribution assessment)
- **Transparent documentation** (exploratory dead-ends included)
- **Reproducible research** (clear methodology, all code provided)

**Dataset:** UCI Online Retail Dataset (~540K transactions, 13 months, UK e-commerce)

## Key Results

| Metric | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| **Customer Base** | 4,372 registered customers segmented into 5 groups |
| **Revenue Concentration** | Top 25% (Champions) contribute ~60% of total revenue |
| **Statistical Validation** | ANOVA confirms segments are significantly distinct (p < 0.001) |
| **Method Agreement** | 70-80% agreement between RFM and k-means approaches |
| **Stability** | >80% segment assignment stability across binning methods |
| **CLV Range** | Champions: £6,732 avg vs Hibernating: £222 avg (30x difference) |

## What Makes This PhD-Level?

### 1. **Methodological Comparison**
- Implemented both RFM quartile scoring AND k-means clustering
- Cross-validated segment assignments between methods
- Calculated silhouette scores and agreement metrics
- **Conclusion:** RFM captures natural data structure (not arbitrary)

### 2. **Sensitivity Analysis**
- Tested robustness by varying binning approach (quartiles → quintiles)
- Measured segment stability (% customers with same assignment)
- **Result:** High stability validates methodological choice

### 3. **Exploratory Dead-Ends**
- Documented transformations that didn't improve results (log scaling)
- Tested independence assumptions (correlation analysis)
- **Why show failures?** Authentic research process, not polished tutorial

### 4. **Assumption Validation**
- Assessed multicollinearity between RFM dimensions
- Evaluated distribution skewness and outlier impact
- Justified quartile approach despite moderate F-M correlation (r ~0.6)

## Business Applications

**Segment-Specific Strategies:**

| Segment | % Customers | % Revenue | Action |
|---------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| **Champions** | 25% | 60% | VIP programs, early access, retention focus |
| **Loyal Customers** | 23% | 25% | Cross-sell campaigns, referral programs |
| **Potential Loyalists** | 18% | 10% | Engagement sequences, purchase incentives |
| **At Risk** | 20% | 4% | Win-back campaigns, churn analysis |
| **Hibernating** | 14% | <1% | Low-cost re-engagement or suppression |

## Project Highlights

### Scientific Rigor Applied to Business Problem
After 16 years in analytical chemistry research, this project demonstrates how experimental design, hypothesis testing, and method validation principles translate directly to business analytics:

- **Data Quality → Sample Preparation:** Rigorous cleaning (removed 25% invalid records)
- **Method Development → Segmentation Validation:** Compared RFM vs k-means
- **Quality Control → Sensitivity Analysis:** Tested parameter robustness
- **Lab Notebook → Documentation:** Transparent reporting of exploratory paths

### Key Analytical Decisions

1. **Why quartiles, not k-means?**  
   Both methods agree (~75%), but quartiles are interpretable for stakeholders

2. **Why not log-transform skewed data?**  
   Tested and rejected—doesn't improve segmentation, reduces interpretability

3. **How do you handle F-M correlation?**  
   Acknowledged but acceptable trade-off for business alignment
